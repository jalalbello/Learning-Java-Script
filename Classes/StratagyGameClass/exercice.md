Here are a few suggestions for enhancing the GameMap class:

    Add a method to initialize the grid with a set of random values. This could be useful for creating a new game map with randomly generated terrain, for example.

    Add a method to check if a given square is occupied by an object (e.g. a player or an enemy). This could be implemented by storing a reference to the object in each square of the grid.

    Add a method to move an object from one square to another. This could be done by updating the object's position in the grid and checking for collisions with other objects or obstacles.

    Add a method to display the game map in a graphical interface, such as a canvas element or an ASCII representation in the console. This could be done using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

    Add methods to handle player input and update the game state. This could include handling keyboard events to move the player, checking for game over conditions, and updating the game map with new objects or obstacles.
