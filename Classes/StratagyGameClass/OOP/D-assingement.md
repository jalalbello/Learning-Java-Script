    Define three interfaces: Shape, Colorable, and Movable.

    The Shape interface should have a single method called getArea, which takes no arguments and returns a number.

    The Colorable interface should have a single method called getColor, which takes no arguments and returns a string.

    The Movable interface should have two methods: moveUp, which takes no arguments and returns nothing, and moveDown, which also takes no arguments and returns nothing.

    Define a class called Circle that implements the Shape and Colorable interfaces. The Circle class should have a single property: radius. It should also have a constructor that sets the radius property. The Circle class should implement the getArea and getColor methods.

    Define a class called Rectangle that implements the Shape and Movable interfaces. The Rectangle class should have two properties: width and height. It should also have a constructor that sets the width and height properties. The Rectangle class should implement the getArea and moveUp/moveDown methods.

    Once you have defined the Circle and Rectangle classes, create a few objects of each type and test that the methods work correctly for each object.
