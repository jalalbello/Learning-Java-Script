Here is an exercise to practice the Open/Closed Principle:

Imagine you are designing a system to calculate the cost of shipping packages based on their weight and destination. The system should be able to handle different shipping methods, such as ground, air, and express, each with its own pricing rules.

    Define the responsibilities of the system. Some possible responsibilities might include:

    Storing information about packages, including their weight and destination
    Calculating the cost of shipping a package based on its weight and destination
    Supporting multiple shipping methods, each with its own pricing rules

    Identify the classes or modules that will be needed to fulfill these responsibilities. Some possible classes might include:

    Package class: responsible for storing information about a package, including its weight and destination
    ShippingMethod class: responsible for calculating the cost of shipping a package based on its weight and destination
    GroundShippingMethod class: a subclass of ShippingMethod that implements the specific pricing rules for ground shipping
    AirShippingMethod class: a subclass of ShippingMethod that implements the specific pricing rules for air shipping
    ExpressShippingMethod class: a subclass of ShippingMethod that implements the specific pricing rules for express shipping

    Design the classes to fulfill their defined responsibilities. Be sure to consider the Open/Closed Principle and ensure that the ShippingMethod class is designed to be open for extension (able to support new shipping methods) but closed for modification (the existing implementation should not need to be changed to support new shipping methods).

    Test the classes to ensure that they are functioning correctly and fulfilling their intended responsibilities.

By following the Open/Closed Principle, you can design a system that is easy to maintain and extend over time, as new shipping methods can be
