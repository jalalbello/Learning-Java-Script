    You have been given a base class called Vehicle, which has a single method called startEngine.

    Your task is to create two derived classes called Car and ElectricCar, which inherit from the Vehicle class.

    The Car class should have a single property: fuelType. The ElectricCar class should have a single property: batteryType.

    Both the Car and ElectricCar classes should have a constructor that sets the appropriate properties.

    Make sure that the Car and ElectricCar classes follow the Liskov Substitution Principle. This means that if a Car object is expected, an ElectricCar object should be able to be used in its place, and vice versa.

    Once you have defined the Car and ElectricCar classes, create a few objects of each type and test that the startEngine method works correctly for each object.
