# Code Tells You How, Comments Tell You <Why></Why>

We spend more time reading the code than working on it
Thus making the code Readable is a necessity

<h3><strong>Rules of Thumb</strong></h3>

- Indentation, it doesn't matter what style you use, just stay consistent
- Semicolons, they are optional but learning to use them will make u avoid issues that may arise
- Line length, Limit the length of each line to 80 charchters for ease of reading, also **break immediately**  after an operator or comma
- Naming, functions and vars should be descriptive, Always use camelCase
    > Vars should begin w noun or adjective
    >>Functions with verbs
    >>> Callbacks and For loops can have single words/char

**You should always write your code as if comments didn't exist**. This forces you to write your code in the simplest, plainest, most self-documenting way you can humanly come up with.
