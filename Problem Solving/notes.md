# Understanding the Problem

Try to make notes, pseudo code, drawing, and explain the issue in plain english.

Not understanding a problem can lead to wasted time in wrong solutions, Knowing where the issues lies exactly will make u tacle it more effectivly


#   Plan


Now that u aimed at the problem, maybe its not a good idea to immediatly start writing code, it's time to plan out how ur going to solve it first.

Try answering the following questions:

- Will it have a UI, if so what would it look like, what functionality will the interface have
- What inputs will the program have, will the user enter data or will u get it from somewhere else
- What Output do u desire
- Given ur inputs, what steps are required to get the output you want

# Divide and Conquer

 Do not try to solve a big problem in one go. If the problem is sufficiently complex, you’ll life a lot harder for yourself. 

 Decomposing problems into smaller and easier to solve subproblems is a much better approach. Decomposition is the main way to deal with complexity, making problems easier and more approachable to solve and understand.

 In short, break the big problem down and solve each of the smaller problems until you’ve solved the big problem.
